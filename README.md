# EOSIO DID

This library is intended to use EOSIO accounts as fully self managed [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#decentralized-identifiers-dids) and wrap them in a [DID Document](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#did-documents)

It supports the proposed [Decentralized Identifiers](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) spec from the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io).

The DID specification can be found at [eosio-did-spec](https://github.com/Gimly-Blockchain/eosio-did-spec).
